<h3 id="sec-1">Overview </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1">


<p>
Void Mission Zero is a sci-fi roguelike game written in Common
Lisp. You play a lone agent infiltrating an automated droid factory
in order to destroy the enemy robots within. To win the game, you
must fight your way through the corridors and chambers of the
factory, cutting through the countless robots infesting the site,
and make your way to the reactor area. There you must destroy the
cooling towers, which will cause the reactor to explode and destroy
the factory.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2">Basic weaponry </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2">


<p>
You begin the game armed with a rusty wrench; at some point you obtain
a ranged particle gun. The particle gun needs batteries; these can be
found randomly in supply crates, or taken from the smashed remains of
robots. (Sometimes supply crates have evil robots in them, too, who'll
jump out and surprise you.)
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3">Grenades </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3">


<p>
There are also two types of grenades. First we have electromagnetic
pulse (EMP) grenades, which damage and temporarily freeze robots (and
you, if you're not careful!). On the other hand, there are
conventional explosive grenades, which do more damage and have no
freezing effect.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4">Perceptors </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4">


<p>
Enemies include various Perceptors (floating spheroid eye-bots with
shock probes). Red perceptors tend to seek the player even when far
away, but purple perceptors wander around randomly until the player
comes near. These are very dangerous to the player, and he must have a
ranged weapon in order to deal with them effectively.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5">Rooks </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5">


<p>
Rooks are large, slow, tank-like turrets-on-wheels. Their roof-mounted
particle cannons are accurate and extremely deadly, but have two
disadvantages.  First, they cannot target immediately adjacent
squares, so the player can survive by getting close and attacking with
a melee weapon. Second, the particle cannon is slow to recharge,
allowing a shot only once every few turns. 
</p>
<p>
Being in an open area with several rooks is a bad idea&mdash;they'll blow
you away. Instead you must lure them one by one into corridors and
fight in close range&mdash;or freeze the group with EMP grenades and blast
away.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6">The Diskarmor </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6">


<p>
The Diskarmor Industries Model 1008 is a semi-autonomous rolling robo
unit. It can be thrown in one of the eight compass directions; upon
colliding with anything, it will do a good amount of damage, and
release shots. So you could throw it down a corridor and have it take
out a few robots when it hits the wall at the end. The Diskarmor will
return to its operator after throwing.

<div id="outline-container-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7">Other </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7">


<p>
Two types of levels: Corridors (i.e. long, unidirectional strip-like
levels with many distinct sections or rooms) and Chambers (sprawling
mazes or arenas.)
</p>
<p>
Player attributes are a bit simplified when compared with a typical
roguelike. Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Constitution, Hit
Points, Psi Points, etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Eyesight (intelligence)
</li>
<li>Hacking (intelligence, dexterity)
</li>
<li>Research (intelligence)
</li>
<li>Close combat (strength, dexterity)
</li>
<li>Ranged combat (strength, dexterity)
</li>
<li>Stealth (dexterity, intelligence)
</li>
<li>Vehicles (dexterity)
</li>
<li>Medicine (intelligence) 
</li>
