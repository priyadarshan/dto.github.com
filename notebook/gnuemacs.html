<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">What's it all about? </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">GNU Emacs</a> is an alternative vision of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-computer_interaction">human-computer interaction</a>
comparable to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk.</a> 
</p>
<p>
At its core is an interpreter for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp">Emacs Lisp</a>. This rich, expressive
language makes it easy to construct powerful interactive
applications. Literally hundreds of such packages are available and
more are being created all the time.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to the icons, buttons, and menus of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">graphical user interface</a>, Emacs and the user communicate largely through
text. Because Emacs is a complete interface to the computer&mdash;with its
own language, libraries, applications, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowing_systems">windowing system</a>&mdash;some
have even described it as an <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EmacsAsOperatingSystem">operating system</a> unto itself. When paired
with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like">UNIX-like</a> OS, in which text is often the primary means of
both data storage and interaction with programs, Emacs becomes a
unified general-purpose computing environment.
</p>
<p>
Emacs is task-oriented and programmable. It lends itself to the
extension of its capabilities by the experienced user. As its users'
individual working styles and problems are diverse, so is the
literature of the user community's program library. That collection of
procedural knowledge is a sort of "collective consciousness" of
Emacs. It has steadily grown in size and sophistication for more than
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?EmacsHistory">three decades</a> now. It contains the distilled lessons and creative
energy of countless people who have used Emacs in their daily work and
who develop methods by which the most elegant and efficient possible
usage of a computer may be effected.
</p>
<p>
This is shown in the enormous variety
of tasks which, in virtue of this program library, Emacs can tackle:
general text editing, numerical and symbolic calculation, the
preparation of technical documents, UNIX shell control, calendaring
and project management, text outlining, online chat, internet
publishing, audio synthesis and processing, and so on.  
</p>
<p>
The notion of text Emacs employs is an extension of the common
definition of text, in that one may also attach items of data called
"properties" to groups of characters. The possible values of a
property are precisely the set of valid Emacs Lisp objects. These
"text properties" may be given different interpretations by the
different programs that examine them.  The interpretations that are
possible within Emacs are such that more advanced operations on, and
more sophisticated views of, the data are possible than would be with
plain text.

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">My own story </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
I never knew much about Emacs until recently. I had tried it in the
late 1990s just to see what it was all about, but I found it
bewildering; I just didn't know where to begin. Eventually I forgot
all about it.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Getting started </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">


<p>
While working at the Boston studio of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_Games">Irrational Games</a> in 2003, I
heard something about Emacs being able to run a command shell inside
of it, and was quite intrigued. Meanwhile my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zire">Palm Zire</a> was rapidly
becoming inadequate as my responsibilities grew&mdash;I needed a better
way to organize my work, and fast. Once I read about <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PlannerMode">Planner</a> I decided
to give Emacs a try. 
</p>
<p>
I was really impressed! Not only did I have a working todo-list and
note-taking system, it even left behind a set of concise daily reports
to show what you accomplished. Before long I was using Emacs for all
of my work: correspondence (quite important when your supervisor lives
in another hemisphere), remote system management, website development
and maintenance, scheduling, and the preparation of numerous
documents&mdash;everything from brief memoranda and itineraries, to much
longer contract bid specifications and project status reports.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I ran into a dead-end somewhere, and wrote a 10-line Emacs
Lisp function to bridge the gap. I was impressed that I could
just <b>make it do what i wanted.</b> Soon I was routinely writing my own
Lisp code, and using <a href="EevMode.html">eev-mode</a> to automate, organize, and document all
the different things I had to do with shells on various
machines. Discussions with <a href="http://angg.twu.net/">Eduardo Ochs</a> and with the Emacs IRC
community added immeasurably to my knowledge.  I fell in love with the
Emacs Lisp language and realized that I was <b>excited</b> about
programming for the first time in years. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Mind-meld with Eduardo </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">


<p>
In 2005 I left Irrational to pursue other opportunities, and started
working full-time on what would become known as the <a href="KarmaPod.html">KarmaPod</a>&mdash;my
GNU/Linux-based portable recording studio and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_music">computer music</a> research
workstation. 
</p>
<p>
I wanted the Pod to look, act, and feel like Emacs. This meant
carefully choosing and configuring applications to work seamlessly
with Emacs, and involved a lot of false starts. Eventually I developed
a <a href="http://dto.freeshell.org/e/color-theme-cl-frame.el">standard color theme</a> and coordinated my <a href="http://fvwm.org">fvwm</a> setup to match it. I
installed <a href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/">Snd</a>&mdash;a fully-featured multichannel audio editor
and mixer loosely modeled after Emacs, and fully extensible with
Scheme. For automated multitrack audio processing and live recording,
I installed <a href="http://eca.cx">ecasound.</a> This is a very useful, if a bit awkward,
multipurpose command-line audio program. It includes Delysid's
<a href="http://delysid.org/emacs/ecasound-el.html">ecasound.el</a> so it can be fully controlled from Emacs.  (I have built
some experimental tools on top of ecasound.el: see <a href="http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/EcaSpace.html">Ecaspace</a>.)
</p>
<p>
But much work was still ahead in making this UI vision into a
reality. For months, Eduardo Ochs and I discussed the user interface
design of the Pod.  During these intense IRC sessions I learned a lot
about Lisp programming, software design, software documentation
processes, and programming aesthetics&mdash;probably more than I had
learned in my undergraduate program. Most of all I have been taught
higher-level programming techniques, and as a result I believe I have
become an order of magnitude more productive as a programmer. So I owe
Eduardo my eternal thanks.

<h3 id="sec-2-3">The search for a new conceptual framework </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">


<p>
By the time I quit my job, I had gotten a bit tired of Planner and
wanted to try something new. I came across a strange and little-known
Japanese mode called <a href="http://howm.sourceforge.jp/">howm</a> and was intrigued by its radically different
approach. Like Planner, it combined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a> concepts with note-taking,
task list, appointments, and links to various content types. Unlike
Planner, the markup was very free-structured, and could be combined
with any major mode. You could embed TODO items within lisp source
code comments, for example. Howm's "goto links" and "come-from links"
could be used to categorize notes and to navigate from one to
another. Soon I discovered that I could freely mix eev-mode and
howm-mode content into other files. I began to feel that some untapped
potential lay deep within Emacs, ready to be teased out by a cowboy
programmer.
</p>
<p>
There was very little English-language documentation available for
Howm, so I wrote a <a href="http://dto.freeshell.org/HowmTutorial.howm.html">Howm Tutorial.</a> But before long I ran into some
things that made Howm seem less palatable to me. It isn't suitable for
structuring longer documents, and there are no export options (such as
HTML.) I wrote a draft of an HTMLizer but soon gave up on Howm
entirely.
</p>
<p>
Then I found <a href="OrgMode.html">org-mode,</a> which is a much better fit for my needs. It
uses <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/OutlineMode">outline-mode</a> to structure and navigate large projects. It has a
simple markup syntax supporting bullets, emphasis, hyperlinks, tables,
images, and multiple nested headings. Org-mode's workflow management
is sophisticated and can be configured for a variety of work
situations and personal styles. Project documents are easily exported
to HTML. In fact, a given project's webpage, TODO-list, and research
notes can all be maintained in the same .org file and published
automatically to the web.
</p>
<p>
I wrote a program called <a href="../e/org-publish.el">org-publish</a> to automate the updates to my
website. It keeps track of modification times of my publishable files,
and converts/uploads pending changes upon request. After Carsten
Dominik decided to include it in the org-mode distribution, I signed
my Emacs copyright assignment papers with the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>
and have since become a proud Emacs developer.

<p>
They say you never truly understand an idea until you have had to
teach it to someone else. It forces you to grasp the concept and put
it into your own words. Recently I have had some experience teaching
Emacs to other people, including some who are not computer
programmers.

GNU Emacs is fantastic! I use it for all my programming, text editing,
chat (with rcirc), email (Gnus), file management (dired-mode), shell
automation (<a href="EevMode.html">eev-mode</a>), calendar, appointments and project planning
(<a href="OrgMode.html">org-mode</a>), writing, web development, music playlists (emms) and
general organization of myself. Emacs even makes this website.
