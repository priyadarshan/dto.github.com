<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">


<p>
Blast Tactics is a rogue-like tactical RPG. The user creates and names
a character with various attributes like strength, dexterity, and
piloting skill. Using a turn-based 2.5D roguelike tactics engine, the
player's character explores interstellar space and conducts various
combat, research, and espionage missions. The main story line is
embedded throughout the game and woven together with procedurally
generated maps and missions. Drivable vehicles protect the player,
enable high-speed aerial combat, and are the primary means of
traveling between different parts of the game. Spacesuit EVA
(extra-vehicular activity) is available for indoor maps. Destructible
environments and hostile conditions (heat, vacuum, radiation) add
strategy to the game. The goal of the game is to complete missions,
upgrade your character and ship, while managing resources like fuel
and money. This non-linear RPG combines a main story with "sandbox"
and varied mission-style gameplay.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">


<p>
Play occurs in a two-dimensional grid where each square can contain a
stack of objects. Each object is represented onscreen by a 16x16 pixel
tile, and where objects stack the tiles are overlaid. The player can
inspect a stack of tiles and choose which to pick up or act upon.
</p>
<p>
All movement and combat are turn-based, with actions using up a
resource called AP (action points). Turn order is determined by a
character's speed rating and AP reserve. Both melee and ranged attacks
are supported.
</p>
<p>
The game's procedurally-generated universe is composed of a set of
arbitrarily interconnected 2D maps. Maps can have different scale
factors, so one map may represent a star sector with several stars to
visit, while each star may have its own map with planets to visit, all
the way down to the corridors of a planetary base.
</p>
<p>
Non-player characters (friend or foe) can speak and emote with
onscreen balloons or animated icons.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">


<p>
It's 2061. If only there were enough endurium!
</p>
<p>
It's been known for decades that Humanity's reach within the Milky Way
is limited only by the supply of endurium, its rare and precious fuel.
As endurium was first brought to Earth at the advent of the present
Droid Plague, its discovery came indeed at the cost of billions of
human lives. But the living space and vast resources of the Milky Way,
and indeed possibly those of the Universe itself, beckon to us with
their promise of the renewed expansion and survival of the human
species.
</p>
<p>
Early attempts at control and regulation of endurium met with initial
success. The space-faring nations&mdash;Russia, China, India, Japan, and
the United States&mdash;along with the ESA (European Space Agency), could
quite naturally claim endurium for themselves. But economies of scale
and espionage in spaceflight technology eventually brought smaller
deposits and endurium dust streams throughout the interstellar
neighborhood within the reach of multinational corporations and
various non-state actors. The largest of these formed what they called
a "sovereign" but otherwise open and successful market in endurium,
spaceflight technology, and various otherwise-controlled
materials. The split between the Spacefaring Nations on the one hand,
and the United Nations on the other, threatens to break into
full-scale interstellar war; as Earth's environment continues to
decay, and as the Droid Plague appears to be with us for the long run,
the demand for endurium has reached a critical point.

<h3 id="sec-2-2">Biosilicates </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">


<p>
The Biosilicates are silicon-based lifeforms who have assimilated
human microprocessor technology in an attempt to amplify their
species' intelligence. But the result of this fusion is less than
organized; a hive's vast mentality is the sum of thousands or even
millions of conflicting sprout minds, each with many gigaflops of
computing power. Still, hives have been seen to act with more
intelligence, even working in concert on some occasions. Some
researchers believe that the biosilicates are adapting to their new
symbiotic environment. 
</p>
<p>
These hives grow raw biosilicate plant material from pollen
deposited by drones. When encountering these gargantuan, gelatinous
hive sacs in space, one must puncture the outer membrane to gain access to
the putrid world within.
</p>
<p>
The green sprouts in grow for 6 generations, and then die. The
generation number is incremented whenever the wandering sprout finds
food (in this case, Biosilicate pollen.) At generation 3, the sprout
becomes stronger (more HP) and also spawns a baby sprout. The result
is a busy, but not explosive growth and propagation of cells as they
consume food and move on. Places with plentiful food tend to form
dense clumps of material, masses of plants which emergently extend
tendrils of plant matter toward the player whenever he approaches.

<h3 id="sec-2-3">The Droid Plague </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">


<p>
On December 23, 2019, a Chinese probe in lunar orbit observes an
irregular black spot on the side of the Moon that permanently faces
away from the Earth. As the probe was designed for high-resolution
multi-wavelength imaging of the Moon's surface, scientists debate in
secret whether the material is natural or artificial in
origin. Although rivers and eddies of this coal-black, smooth material
are visible, shifting geometric patterns are observed, with some
groups of triangular features persisting for days or weeks. The black
spot grows rapidly, prompting the NASA/ESA/Chinese working group to
attempt lowering the satellite's orbit in order to take a closer look.
</p>
<p>
The rest is history; the satellite's approach is interpreted as a
threat, and before telemetry is lost, millions of pyramid-shaped
drones are seen emerging from the blackness. A year later, humanity
had shrunk to an estimated 1 billion people. The Lunar Black Spot is
eventually destroyed by carpet-bombing it with nuclear warheads, and
the immediate droid presence around Earth is brought under control,
but the planet is decimated and the species on the verge of real
decline. The manufacture of an estimated 4 billion drones during the
war consumed 0.0002 percent of the Moon's mass and altered its
rotation and orbit, wreaking havoc on Earth's climate.

<h3 id="sec-2-4">New opportunities </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">


<p>
The mineral Endurium is used as fuel by the Black Metal and by the
drones it manufactures. The discovery of this vital energy source, and
the faster-than-light travel made possible by Droid technology, have
utterly transformed the prospects of the human species. The entire
universe is now ours to explore, populate, and exploit&mdash;if the Black
Metal can be contained in the long term.

<div id="outline-container-2-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-5">Origins of the blackness </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">


<p>
Thus far the droid plague has not been connected with any known
purpose, but researchers believe that the Black Metal is artificial in
origin and may in fact be a kind of liquid supercomputer. Radio decay
dating techniques show that some deposits of the metal are as old as
ten million years. The artificial nature of this computing substrate
taken together with its extreme age led scientists to postulate a race
of "Ancients" who created the Black Metal and either fled or were
wiped out by it. It is unknown whether any other species have
inherited the technology left behind by the Ancients.

<h3 id="sec-2-6">Making contact </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">


<p>
Researchers believe the Black Metal is dispersed throughout the
galaxy, and it is believed that some larger deposits harbor a form of
consciousness.

<h3 id="sec-2-7">The Black Sun </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">


<p>
Eventually the player discovers a supermassive star encased in a shell
of Black Metal. The sheer volume of the black metal and the star's
incredible energy output combine to create a terrifyingly vast
intelligence that has observed the universe for 11 billion years.

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Save system </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
That character death should incur a huge penalty is a major feature of
the rogue-like genre. Blast Tactics's save system is a compromise
between console-style "save points" and the roguelike "permadeath".
</p>
<p>
There is no permadeath in Blast Tactics; but your opportunities to
save a <i>restorable</i> game are limited. 
</p>
<p>
A "game" of Blast Tactics runs from character creation until death.  A
gameplay session lasts from when you start up Blast Tactics, until you
either Save and Quit or just Quit. A "sortie" is the time between saves.
</p>
<p>
An autosave system prevents crashes from destroying more than a few
minutes of gameplay. The autosave is also used when you quit, so that
a game can last many gameplay sessions.
</p>
<p>
When you die, the current sortie is canceled out, and you can only
restore from the last save point. So while there is a substantial
penalty to death in Blast Tactics, the save system is tailored to
balance this with the expectations of modern gamers while still
presenting a challenge.

<h3 id="sec-4-5">Derelict freighters </h3>

<p>
The player must leave the vehicle in a spacesuit, with an oxygen
supply and gravity boots, in order to explore these dark
environments. Droids designed for capturing freighters
</p>
<p>
Some freighters are used by droids for reproduction, and these can
never be fully cleared of droids. Sometimes more powerful droids are
being manufactured in a given freighter, and this may result in player
death, so each freighter should be taken carefully. Limited lighting
and careful use of sound will create tension. 
</p>
<p>
Freighters are a source of human supplies (medkits, upgrades,
stim-packs, weapons, ammo) and in order to fully explore some
freighters, the player must make use of oxygen tanks and even recover
oxygen from dead crew members. (Some crewmembers are zombies and
attack the player.)
</p>
<p>
These ships also figure into the storyline, in that the huge increase
in human shipping and exploration activity in the Antares sector
awakened the Black Planet and caused it to begin using freighters as
eggs for its "children".
