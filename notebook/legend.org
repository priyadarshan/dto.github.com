I recently learned that Ridley Scott's 1985 fantasy film [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_(film)][Legend]] exists
in several very different versions. Up until yesterday I had seen only
the U.S. theatrical release on Cable TV and VHS years ago as a
kid. When I sat down to watch the original 1985 director's cut of the
film (more recently available on DVD) I did not realize that as
originally made, /Legend/ is actually a far better and more
sophisticated film than what you are likely to have seen.

That is, if you saw the film at all. U.S. critics panned /Legend/ for
its seemingly thin and confusing story, despite praise for the visuals
and the standout performance of Tim Curry. Roger Ebert and others
criticized its lack of depth and reliance on special effects rather
than character development---a common criticism of other 80's fantasy
films like /The Dark Crystal/.

---the version Ridley Scott made in
1985, and then the various heavily re-edited, cut, and dubbed versions
released variously in Europe and the United States by the movie
studio.
