#+DESCRIPTION: Eon creeps toward beta

There have been many changes in [[http://dto.mamalala.org/notebook/eon.html][the Eon object system]] since the alpha
release. Some of it was refactoring; other parts were inspired by
research into newer object-oriented languages like [[http://iolanguage.com][Io]], and a great
deal of commentary and feedback from fellow developers. In any case,
the design and implementation are firming up.

Here's a screenshot of the new version:
