<h1 class="title">Why you should support ELPA</h1>

<p>ELPA is the <a href="http://tromey.com/elpa">Emacs Lisp Package Archive</a>. 
</p>
<p>
GNU Emacs&mdash;like every computing platform&mdash;sorely needs an official
package system and software repository. This is no simple matter of
convenience for users, although convenience is a big motivating
factor. I argue that the official adoption of package.el and ELPA will
have an enormously beneficial impact on the Emacs Lisp development
community, and that not doing so will hold back Emacs as a development
platform.
</p>
<p>
It's common to base one's code on libraries included with Emacs (for
example comint-mode) because you know they'll be available to all
Emacs users. But building your application to re-use code from
multiple non-FSF packages from all over the Internet isn't such a safe
bet, because your users will have to locate and install these
separately-maintained packages by themselves, and hope that the URLs
don't change, and hope that when they're finally installed they will
work together. As a result people play it safe, and thus there are 
many different reimplementations of common things like dired-ish
interfaces in the elisp space; countless packages have their
own way of doing it, some more featureful, some less, all with
different commands and faces (so that you cannot easily customize
their behavior and appearance as a group.)  Such lack of re-use is, in
my view, a drag on the overall development of Emacs Lisp as a language
and as a computing platform. And I don't mean "re-use" in any sort of
fancy object-technology brochure sense of the term, but rather simply
recognizing that we don't have to reinvent the wheel.
</p>
<p>
RMS is against adopting a package system, for several reasons. Here is the first:
</p>
<pre class="example">
1. It could reduce the incentive for people to assign copyright on
their code.
</pre>


<p>
(Excerpted from <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/70701/focus=71454">this rms email</a>).
</p>
<p>
There are so many things wrong with this first item that I need a bullet list:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To the extent that we can view third-party packages as <b>potential</b>
   FSF property, these packages becoming featureful, stable, and
   standards-compliant enough for assignment to the FSF will actually
   be <b>more likely</b> if it is easier for all those bug-finding and
   feature-suggesting users to find, download, install, configure, and
   use those packages by using ELPA.
</li>
<li>This argument does not account for packages that will likely
   <b>never</b> be contributed to FSF. There are countless very useful and
   popular packages whose authors will not or cannot assign their
   copyright, for various reasons: I believe MULE is owned by the
   government of Japan, for instance. To use a more widespread
   example, the FSF disallows (require 'cl) in code included with GNU
   Emacs, and so the many packages that do this (all of mine, for
   example) will therefore not be assigned to the FSF in any case.
</li>
<li>Third-party elisp developers (which is probably most of them)
   become "unsupported", i.e. second-class citizens. This is a snub to
   the very community whose code the FSF seeks for inclusion in Emacs.
</li>
<li>For the software to be deliberately crippled in some way in order
   to discourage the use of third-party packages is behavior I would
   expect from Microsoft, not the FSF. And it is crippling&mdash;try to
   imagine Debian without its package system.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
As for the second of RMS's reasons for not adopting a package
system:
</p>
<pre class="example">
2. It would mean that Emacs refers people very strongly to a site that
isn't run by the GNU Project.  I don't know what their policies are.
But even if they are good, now, we have no way to assure that remains
so.
</pre>


<p>
(Excerpted from <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/70701/focus=71454">this rms email</a>).
</p>
<p>
This is pretty simple to deal with. We can have this problem with
one site that is at least affiliated with the GNU project in some
way (i.e. ELPA), or we can have this same problem with the thousand
sites that currently distribute the non-FSF elisp that Emacs users use
every day. We cannot wish away the user's need to develop and use
third-party code, or their right to do so outside the FSF's umbrella.
</p>
<p>
RMS presents an alternative:
</p>
<pre class="example">
These problems would be eliminated if we put the package repository on
gnu.org and limit it to packages that are copyright FSF.
</pre>


<p>
(Excerpted from <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/70701/focus=71454">this rms email</a>).
</p>
<p>
But then the package system would be pointless&mdash;could it really be
useful for installing just the software that already comes with GNU
Emacs?
</p>
<p>
You can help this situation by supporting <a href="http://tromey.com/elpa">ELPA</a> and contributing your
code.
