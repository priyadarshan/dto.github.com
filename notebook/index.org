file:../images/dto-xface-orange-big.png

  My name is Dave and this is my website. I am a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software][free software
  volunteer]], [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][GNU Emacs user]], [[file:games.org][video game programmer]] and concerned
  citizen of the United States.
  
  You can [[mailto:dto@ioforms.org][email me]]. I can also be reached as "dto" on Internet Relay
  Chat, freenode channel #lispgames.
  
  I also maintain a [[http://blocky.io/blog/][Lisp games development blog.]]

  My main software development project right now is [[http://blocky.io][Blocky]], a visual
  programming language based on Common Lisp.
