#+DESCRIPTION: RLX progress report

I've got about half of [[http://dto.mamalala.org/notebook/rlx.html][my graphical roguelike engine]] ported to Common
Lisp. Enough is working to have a world of little robots moving around
as the player explores, but there isn't really a "game" happening, as
I haven't yet ported over many of the required features. But the
hardest parts are done now. Here's a screenshot (click to zoom):
