<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
In the game of CONS you are a sentient warrior <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons">cons cell</a>. In each
randomly generated mission you will infiltrate and sabotage an alien
military installation. 
</p>
<p>
CONS is in a playable alpha state and is available for Windows, Mac
OSX (Intel only), and GNU/Linux. Please visit the <a href="http://github.com/dto/xe2/downloads">downloads page</a> to
choose the right file for your platform.
</p>
<p>
This is not a finished game, but your comments and feedback are
welcome. Many user requests and suggestions have made it into the
game; tell me what you want and perhaps I'll implement it!
</p>
<p>
My <a href="games.html">games page</a> has links to my other games.

<p>
The player is composed of several square 16x16 pixel pieces whose
movements follow one another like a centipede. At the start of the
game, there is the "agent", i.e. the head of the snake, and three
segments. Each body segment is one inventory slot; adding body
segments upgrades one's inventory, but since segments are also
susceptible to enemy fire, these upgrades also increase your
vulnerability. 
</p>
<p>
All gameworld interaction is accomplished with the arrow keys, shift,
and the keys Z and X:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrow keys (or numeric keypad) for movement.
</li>
<li>Shift-arrow for activating the selected inventory item.
    If this is a gun for example, you fire in that direction.
</li>
<li>Z to change the selected inventory item
</li>
<li>X for picking up items, activating switches, and so on.
</li>
<li>C to drop the selected inventory item
</li>
</ul>

Right now there is no fancy installer, but you can still download and
run the game with a few clicks.
</p>
<p>
First, your browser will probably ask you whether to <b>Open</b> the
download, or <b>Save</b> it to disk. <b>CHOOSE SAVE TO DISK</b> and put it
wherever you want. If you are just trying out the game, you can put it
on your Windows desktop.
</p>
<p>
Second, <b>RIGHT-CLICK</b> the CONS zip file and choose EXTRACT or EXPAND
or UNZIP (this may vary depending on your version of Windows.) If it
asks for a destination folder, choose the Desktop.
</p>
<p>
Third and finally, <b>DOUBLE-CLICK</b> the CONS-alpha-N-win32 folder that
should now be on the Desktop. The folder should open into an Explorer
window. Scroll down to <b>CONS.EXE</b> and double-click it. That's it!
Sorry, we are working on improving the installer.

<li>You need the libsdl, libsdl-mixer, libsdl-image, and libsdl-gfx
      libraries installed via your distribution's package manager.

</li>
<li>If the game complains about <code>libsdl_gfx</code> not found, it will give
      you the option at the command line to choose between several
      restarts. Choose CONTINUE and it should work. 

</li>
<li><b>If you get errors about paths and configuration</b> when trying to
      start up, see <a href="http://github.com/dto/xe2/blob/master/BINARY-README">these notes</a> for a fix. In particular, you can add
      a line like:
</li>
</ol>


<pre class="example">
(setf xe2:*module-directories* '(#P"/home/dto/xe2/"))
</pre>


<p>
      to a file called <code>.xe2rc</code> in your home directory. We are working
      on fixing this bug.
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>If you get no sound</b>, you may need to install the pulseaudio
      version of SDL-MIXER from your distribution's package library.
      This will replace the raw ALSA version of SDL-MIXER and fix the
      problem. The package name you want on Ubuntu Karmic is 
      <code>libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio</code>

</li>
<li>If you still can't get any of the binaries running, or if there
      is no binary for your system, see <a href="http://github.com/dto/xe2/blob/master/INSTALL">the developer's install guide</a>
      for instructions on making your own binary.

<p>
Each enemy base is rectangular in shape, where each grid square (or
"sector") therein represents a different type of facility (and a
different randomly-generated game level.)  This is the game's
"overworld map" if you will, but it is limited in size to between 4x4
and possibly as high as 16x16 on a higher difficulty setting. 
</p>
<p>
In each sector, one or more goals must be completed, such as defeating
all enemies, defeating a particular enemy, retrieving an item, or
unlocking a doorway. Once your total mission is complete, a
victory/scoring screen is displayed, and then the game ends. Death
also ends the game.
</p>
<p>
The different sector types are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Archive (AR)
</li>
<li>Security (SE)
</li>
<li>Storage (ST)
</li>
<li>Reactor (RX)
</li>
<li>Corridor (CO)
</li>
</ul>


<p>
(In addition there may be surprise sector types which occur rarely and
may figure into an overarching story of some kind.)
</p>
<p>
The contents and varying goals of each sector must be discovered as
the player visits them; only squares adjacent to a sector whose
objectives are completed, may be identified and visited. One may
complete goals and sectors in any available order, and return to
different areas as needed (for example, running back to an Archive to
retrieve more healing items.)
</p>
<p>
Each sector generator has a "level" parameter that can trigger
additional behaviors intended to make a level more difficult and more
rewarding. The general difficulty of the game can be ramped by
generating map squares of appropriate difficulty levels.
