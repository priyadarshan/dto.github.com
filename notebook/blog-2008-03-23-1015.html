<h1 class="title">Eon and RLX move to Common Lisp</h1>

<p>I've ported the prototype-based Eon object system to Common Lisp. 
</p>
<p>
There are several reasons why I've done this. Eon began its life in
late 2006 as the core world-representation of the <a href="http://dto.mamalala.org/notebook/rlx.html">RLX roguelike engine</a>. This was a great working proof-of-concept, and taught me a lot
about Lisp programming. But ultimately the limitations of Emacs have
led me to abandon the idea of implementing the RLX engine itself in
Emacs Lisp. Emacs' execution model is not suitable for realtime play,
so the engine itself would have been limited to turn-based action.
The display engine was limited to rectilinear grids of tiles, because
Emacs can't overlap images at all&mdash;that's another limitation of
roguelikes that I've been trying to move past. 
</p>
<p>
Another big, obvious problem was speed. RLX could only handle
relatively small maps, about 60x60 tiles&mdash;not the expansive
landscapes I dream of. The ray-casting code was fast enough, but the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*">A-star pathfinding</a> code&mdash;for which I wrote my own optimized heap
implementation&mdash;was just too slow, even with only a few enemies doing
the pathfinding. This conflicted with my goal of having sophisticated
AI with many enemies onscreen at once (see also my design notes for
<a href="http://dto.mamalala.org/notebook/voidmission.html">Void Mission</a>.)
</p>
<p>
The last straw was sound support. I run a small recording studio and
have been producing sound effects and music for Void Mission all
along. Emacs would have been up to the task of playing ogg files in
the background, but sound effects synchronized with the action would
have been nearly impossible.
</p>
<p>
I'd already considered Common Lisp as the natural next step for RLX
2.0, so I decided to get moving. I'm using <a href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/">SBCL</a> and <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a> with
<a href="http://lispbuilder.sourceforge.net/">Lispbuilder-SDL</a> as the graphics-and-sound library. Because I already
used many Common Lisp idioms in my elisp programming (thanks to the
Emacs CL package), the porting has been surprisingly easy.
</p>
<p>
Emacs is still a crucial part of the picture. The RLX system will
still contain a substantial portion of Emacs Lisp code, including
<a href="http://dto.mamalala.org/notebook/cellmode.html">cell-mode</a> and possibly a pixel art editor, because GNU Emacs will
remain as the integrated development environment for RLX game modules
and their resources.
</p>
<p>
I guess this represents a sea-change in my view of GNU Emacs. Before,
it was a picture that was a bit too large for its frame; at this
point, I see Emacs as one integral part of an ensemble that includes
Common Lisp, Debian, and many other fine projects.
