#+DESCRIPTION: Boole's "Laws of Thought"

I've been in the mood to dig a bit deeper into the past of mathematics
and logic and philosophy. So I've taken a break from the early
twentieth-century Russell and Wittgenstein to take a look at the
origins of pure mathematics and logic---in George Boole's 1854
treatise "An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, On Which are
Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities."

A [[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15114][fully TeXed]] version is available free of charge from the Gutenberg
Project.

It's exciting to read the genesis of Boolean logic here:

: "... instead of determining the measure of formal agreement of the
: symbols of Logic with those of Number generally, it is more
: immediately suggested to us to compare them with symbols of quantity
: admitting only of the values 0 and 1. Let us conceive, then, of an
: Algebra in which the symbols x, y, z etc. admit indifferently of the
: values 0 and 1, and of these values alone."
 
  - from Chapter 2, "Signs and their Laws"

Fascinating stuff.
