<p>
REMIX THIS GAME is an experimental game design contest where
participants can re-mix and re-cycle my free-software self-published
PC game, <a href="http://dto.github.com/notebook/xong.html">XONG</a>. XONG is available under permissive licenses allowing
remixes and derivative works of the code, graphics, sound effects, and
music&mdash;even for commercial use. The source code license is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU GPL Version 3</a>, and the media is covered by the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">Creative Commons BY-SA license</a>.
</p>
<p>
No special software or programming experience are needed&mdash;XONG
has been packaged up so that you can just download the game and edit
the graphics/code/music/sounds in place, and re-start the game to see
your changes. Plus, it is available for Windows, Mac OSX, and GNU/Linux,
so you can remix it on whichever OS you use, using whatever programs
you like.
</p>
<p>
Registration is now open; <a href="http://www.cliki.net/RemixThisGame">sign yourself up here</a>. As the author of
XONG, I will choose the winner and three runners up, and do a blog
post about each entry with (if you choose) an interview or other
info. <b>NOTE: The deadline for submission has been extended to August 10, 2010.</b> There is no real prize other than participation in something
new, and possible notoriety for doing something interesting.
</p>
<p>
See "How do I get started?"  below for more details on how to remix
the game.
</p>
<p>
REMIX THIS GAME is part of the <a href="http://dto.github.com/notebook/2010expo.html">2010 International Lisp Games Expo.</a>

<h2 id="sec-2">What is XONG? </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
XONG is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free</a>, fast-moving procedurally-generated puzzle combat game
for Microsoft Windows, Mac OSX, and GNU/Linux. XONG is for one player
using a keyboard and mouse. See the <a href="http://dto.github.com/notebook/xong.html">XONG page</a> for information,
downloads, and links to what people are saying about XONG.

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Why? </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
REMIX THIS GAME is inspired by a <a href="http://trsp.net/teaching/gamemod/">university experiment</a> I read about,
in which a classroom full of mixed programmer and non-programmer
students were given a short <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_clone">Breakout clone</a> written in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language)">Processing language</a>, and spent a few hours making various code changes
interactively to the game while it ran. A few helpers went around to
troubleshoot issues, but almost everyone came up with something cool,
with some entries seeming radically unrelated to the original program.
</p>
<p>
So I invite you to <a href="http://dto.github.com/notebook/xong.html">download XONG</a> and:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the rules of player, object, and enemy behavior
</li>
<li>Add new objects and enemies
</li>
<li>Speed it up or slow it down or sync it to a beat
</li>
<li>Resize/redraw the graphics, color schemes, redesign the level
    generator
</li>
<li>Add a compelling story with non-player characters and heavy
    exploration
</li>
<li>Implement gravity and change it to a platformer
</li>
<li>Implement a completely different game using the same graphics
</li>
<li>Remix the songs (XM tracker format included for most songs)
</li>
<li>Share your new creations with the world!
</li>
</ul>


<p>
XONG has a few bugs and problems, and players have had many
suggestions for changes. So you will probably think of things to
change about the game. Furthermore, it's relatively simple and small
(only 2257 lines of game-specific code.)
</p>
<p>
I'd like to assemble a gallery and video compilation of people's
entries when the contest is over.

<h2 id="sec-4">How do I get started? </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
Just download <a href="http://dto.github.com/notebook/xong.html">XONG</a> for your platform, extract the files, and start
editing! All the objects and images are in standard PNG format; the
sounds are WAV; the music is OGG Vorbis (with source XM files for many
songs.) The source code is distributed among several text files such
as <a href="http://github.com/dto/xe2/blob/master/xong/player.lisp">player.lisp</a> and <a href="http://github.com/dto/xe2/blob/master/xong/enemy.lisp">enemy.lisp</a>, and also a human-editable resource data
file called <a href="http://github.com/dto/xe2/blob/master/xong/xong.pak">xong.pak</a>.
</p>
<p>
As an example from XONG, just below is the complete code for an enemy
called the Oscillator. See the documentation in <a href="http://github.com/dto/xe2/blob/master/cells.lisp">cells.lisp</a> for more
detailed information on what each field means&mdash;for now, just remember
that "cells" are generic game objects, and the "defcell" below defines
a new kind of cell with specified properties. The "define-method"
forms add actions to cells.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(defcell oscillator 
  (tile :initform "oscillator") 
  (categories :initform '(:actor :obstacle :target :enemy :opaque :oscillator :puck))
  (speed :initform (make-stat :base 3))
  (movement-cost :initform (make-stat :base 20))
  (default-cost :initform (make-stat :base 20))
  (direction :initform (car (one-of '(:south :west))))
  (stepping :initform t)
  (dead :initform nil)
  (name :initform "Oscillator")
  (description :initform 
"These bounce back and forth very quickly, firing muon particles if
the player gets too close."))

(define-method get-nasty oscillator ()
  [damage [get-player *world*] 1])

(define-method loadout oscillator ()
  (incf *enemies*))

(define-method cancel oscillator ()
  (decf *enemies*))

(define-method run oscillator ()
  (if [obstacle-in-direction-p *world* &lt;row&gt; &lt;column&gt; &lt;direction&gt;]
      (setf &lt;direction&gt; (opposite-direction &lt;direction&gt;))
      (progn [move self &lt;direction&gt;]
           (if (and (&gt; 8 [distance-to-player self])
                    [line-of-sight *world* &lt;row&gt; &lt;column&gt; 
                                   [player-row *world*]
                                   [player-column *world*]])
               [fire self [direction-to-player self]]))))

(define-method fire oscillator (direction)
  (let ((muon (clone =muon-particle=)))
    [drop self muon]
    [expend-action-points self 100]
    [impel muon direction] ))

(define-method damage oscillator (points)
  [get-nasty self])

(define-method die oscillator ()
  (unless &lt;dead&gt;
    (decf *enemies*)
    (score 5000)
    [play-sample self "death-alien"]
    [parent&gt;&gt;die self]))
  
(define-method kick oscillator (direction)
  (setf &lt;direction&gt; direction)
  [move self direction])
</pre>


<p>
You can edit and/or replace the game logic and rules with any text
editor, and alter the images/sounds with your favorite tools. The game
logic is written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">the Common Lisp programming language</a>, but because
the XONG executable contains an embedded Lisp compiler, restarting the
game will cause your code changes to be recompiled when you restart
the game. No Lisp experience or special software is required&mdash;just
make backups, and start tweaking!  You can also <a href="http://github.com/dto/xe2/tree/master/xong/">browse the XONG source</a>
online.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">wikipedia page on Common Lisp</a> has more than enough
information to help you read the game's source code and start making
significant changes. Detailed documentation on the underlying <a href="http://dto.github.com/notebook/xe2-reference.html">XE2 game engine</a> is also available, with specific advice on tools if you decide
to tweak heavily or set up a proper Common Lisp development
environment. There is also a good <a href="http://www.cliki.net/Education">cliki page</a> about getting started
with Common Lisp.
