#+TITLE: Ligeti: a process-music composition system
* Status

 *2007-05-20* -- I'm close to completing an 0.9 release.  You can
check out http://dto.freeshell.org/e/ligeti.el but it is not usable
yet. I need to write the GUI using cell-mode...

* About 

Ligeti is a system for the composition of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_music][process music]]. It is named
after the composer [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Ligeti][György Ligeti.]] The musician selects from a library
of audio "activities". An activity is a template for an audio
synthesis process. The activities are arranged into a unified whole
through manual sequencing, automated composition, or a combination of
the two. The piece is then rendered to disk using [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csound][csound]]. The user may
create new activities and compositional algorithms.

Ligeti and its user interface are
implemented in Emacs Lisp. The
following programs are required:

 - [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][GNU Emacs]] 22.X
 - Stéphane Rollandin's [[http://www.zogotounga.net/comp/csoundx.html][csound-x for Emacs]] 
 - [[http://www.csounds.com][csound]]

* Design

 - An "activity" is an abstraction of a csound instrument.  Activities
   are represented as lisp functions that produce csound instrument
   definitions suitable for csound-x's orchestra code transcription
   engine. These functions accept full Common Lisp keyword parameter
   lists and are fully documented.

   + (find-function 'csl-transcribe-to-code)

 - An "event" is an abstraction of a csound i-statement. It triggers
   an activity, causing it to generate sound. 
 - A "sequence" is a set of events taken together as a bundle. These
   are simply lisp lists of events.
 - A sequence may also be an event, i.e. the sequence itself is
   triggered at a certain time

* Music concepts

 - oscillating loops
 - drones
 - melodic fragments, pointillism
 - arhythmic ambient pieces, also technoish stuff
