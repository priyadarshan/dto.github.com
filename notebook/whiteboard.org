* About

Whiteboard is an experimental toy for [[file:GnuEmacs.org][GNU Emacs]]. It allows two remote
emacs users to: 
    
    - chat (similar to IRC)
    - share files via *rsync* 
    - share buffers for taking notes or developing code snippets. this
      is like having a private lisppaste server. 

  More features are planned. Please keep in mind, at this stage
  Whiteboard is an immature and experimental program. There are
  known bugs. *Use at your own risk*.
