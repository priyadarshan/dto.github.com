* Overview

file:../images/big-player.png

Void Mission Zero is a sci-fi roguelike game written in Common
Lisp. You play a lone agent infiltrating an automated droid factory in
order to destroy the enemy robots within. To win the game, you must
fight your way through the corridors and chambers of the factory,
cutting through the countless robots infesting the site, and make your
way to the reactor area on level 10. There you must destroy the
cooling towers, which will cause the reactor to explode and destroy
the factory.

The main ideas of Void Mission gameplay are:

 - Turn-based strategic ranged and hand combat utilizing particle
   guns, robot suits, and vehicles, often with dozens of enemies at
   once
 - Destructible and persistent environments
 - Exploration and discovery
 - Diverse gameplay styles (shooter, stealth, rpg)
 - Randomly generated settings for a new experience each time.
 - Atmospheric enhancement, with optional mood music. 

* Setting and structure

The story of Void Mission takes place in a remote research outpost
called Installation 774. It is the size of a small city and is
composed of square, uniformly-sized, interconnected modules whose
interiors may be configured for different purposes and environmental
conditions. For example:

 - Cold storage
 - Datacenter
 - Crew barracks
 - Recreation area
 - Command center 
 - Laboratory
 - Garage (armored suits, trucks, repair)
 - Medical (health items)
 - Robotics lab

These modules are about the size of one city block, approx 60x60
cells. Various airlocks separate the modules from one another. Some
modules have become depressurized and therefore you need an armored
robo suit to explore them. Some areas are so radioactive or toxic that
only a remote-controlled bot can enter.

The city is designed to house about 1,000 employees, contractors,
military personnel, and various visitors.

* Stats

You have the following stats to keep track of:

** DONE Action points (AP). 

Every action has an AP cost.

** DONE Speed (SPD). 

 Number of action points to spend each turn.

** DONE Hit points (HP). 

When this reaches zero, you die:

** DONE Energy (EN).  

Energy weapons use up these points when fired.  When this reaches
zero, you cannot fire energy weapons until you recharge at least part
of the gauge.

** TODO Oxygen level (OX). 

When this reaches zero, you rapidly lose HP until you die.

You can pick up items like Energy capsules to refill the EN gauge,
Oxygen tanks for the OX gauge, and Medpacks for the HP gauge.

* Terrain

At the beginning of each randomly generated mission, the Corporation
will air-drop you into the area of operations, and you begin fighting.

Mission terrain varies, and will include sand with rocky outcroppings,
ice canyons, machine highways, deep mazes, and massive droid-infested
factories. 

** DONE Basic factory/maze 				  :alpha:
** TODO More mission types				   :beta:

* Combat

** DONE Ranged combat 					  :alpha:

file:../images/rlx-tweaked-1.png

Ranged combat dominates the game. There are two firing modes;
directional mode, in which you fire in a straight line along one of
the eight compass directions; and targeted mode, in which a targeting
cursor can be moved around the screen to fire at particular enemies:

:
:    	   	$
:    @.
:      ......
:      	    ..:::
:	   $  :$:
:	      :::
:
:    KEY: @=player $=enemy .=shot :=cursor

*** DONE Directional ranged combat 			  :alpha:
*** TODO Targeted ranged combat				  :alpha:

** Melee combat 					  :alpha:
CLOSED: [2008-12-07 Sun 10:32]

Melee combat serves two purposes:

  1. The rusty wrench is a ready fall-back weapon in situations where
     you run out of ammo or energy.
  2. Balancing powerful weapons. For example an energy blade weapon
     could be very devastating, but not useful against very fast
     opponents.

** DONE Wrench 						  :alpha:
** TODO Energy blade					   :beta:

* Enemies

The enemies may be human employees of other corporations, or hostile
alien/robot forms.

** DONE Perceptors					  :alpha:
CLOSED: [2008-11-25 Tue 15:20]

"Perceptors" are (floating spheroid eye-bots with shock probes). Red
perceptors tend to seek the player even when far away, but purple
perceptors wander around randomly until the player comes near. These
are very dangerous to the player, and he must have a ranged weapon in
order to deal with them effectively.

** TODO Pathfinding Graviceptor				   :beta:

** TODO Rooks						  :beta:

Rooks are large, slow, tank-like turrets-on-wheels. Their roof-mounted
particle cannons are accurate and extremely deadly, but have two
disadvantages.  First, they cannot target immediately adjacent
squares, so the player can survive by getting close and attacking with
a melee weapon. Second, the particle cannon is slow to recharge,
allowing a shot only once every few turns.

Being in an open area with several rooks is a bad idea---they'll blow
you away. Instead you must lure them one by one into corridors and
fight in close range---or freeze the group with EMP grenades and blast
away.

** TODO Bases						  :beta:

* DONE Ion Shield 					  :alpha:

file:../images/shield.png

The shield creates a barrier around you.

:
:  +-----+
:  |     |
:  |  @	 |
:  |     |
:  +-----+
:
:  KEY: @=player +-|=shield

The shield doesn't move with you.

:

:  |     |
:  |  	 |
:  |   @ |
:  +-----+
:
:  KEY: @=player +-|=shield

The shield fades after a few turns. It can also be damaged by shots:

:
:
:      	     	    ...$
:      	      .......
:  +-- --......

* Ideas for roguelike activities

 - Confront dozens or even hundreds of enemies at a time
 - Wreak havoc in highly destructible environments
 - Mine minerals and manufacture stuff with them
 - Run around placing bombs on other objects/enemies, then run away
   and explode them! This idea is stolen from the PlayStation game
   "Silent Bomber."
 - Feel the paranoia of never knowing what is around the corner
 - Pit yourself against time as maps fill up with water or poison gas
 - Destroy security cameras to prevent the BLS from seeing you
 - Create temporary force fields to block enemies and protect yourself.
 - Upgrade skills with chips/software/modules. You can find them by
   taking apart other machines.
 - Locate schematics for fantastic devices and build them using raw
   materials and manufacturing work stations.
 - Remote-control a limited robot in areas with too much radiation for humans to explore
 - Get radiation sickness and take antidotes
 - Experience and deal with extremes of temperature
 - Researching objects, requires a workstation and research skill
 - Stealth play, sneaking through dark areas to avoid detection
 - Explore a machine-hollowed planetoid whose surface is speckled with
   numerous robotic installations and mysterious crash sites from a
   previous expedition
 - Homage to Compile: a roguelike inspired by Zanac, Aleste, and Guardian Legend
   (this could absorb many of the ideas above)
 - Surround yourself with slave robots who do your bidding and defend you from enemies
 - Wear mecha suits of different types and capabilities. 
 - Dyson sphere exploration (whoa)
 - Opening of game: ship runs out of fuel soon after. You're stuck
   with no weapons, no fuel = no unassisted overworld travel.
 - The ship in orbit guides you through the early part of the game and
   helps introduce the backplot, via radio, but they are destroyed by
   the BLS after the game's first real challenge.
 - OK so i'm going to steal the rather cliche concept of a
   hyper-powerful race of Ancients who leave artifacts behind. Except,
   they did not inhabit our galaxy and only left behind a few sites,
   maybe three, which are jealously guarded and exploited by the
   Corporation for their technological value. What you discover is
   that this planet was a research station for the ancients, which
   makes it extraordinarily valuable in terms of technology and
   information.  Thus, the Corporation and the Authority, already in
   deep conflict, are both vying for control of this planet. The
   ancients are not gone, they just left the milky way out of fear of
   the BLS once it took over. The BLS is one of their experiments gone
   wrong. The Ancients created the faster-than-light drive, which
   humans discovered in a ship floating derelict. In fact perhaps the
   Corporation and the Authority have a monopoly on FTL travel and
   control it very strictly.

** Stats
   
In the RPG system for Void Mission, numeric quantities like skills and
characteristics are subsumed into one idea: *stats*.

Both characteristics and skills enable you to do something, and can
change:
        - permanently, as when leveling up
	- temporarily while certain items are equipped 
	- temporarily while a certain effect is active

Stat values factor into various computations: for example, eyesight
could determine the radius of your vision under normal lighting. 

*** Basic stats
      
 - Strength (attack power).			
 - Intelligence (perception, etc)
 - Dexterity (attack/defence success)
 - Constitution

*** Secondary stats 

 - Hit Points (HP) - from Constitution and Strength
 - Psi Points - from Constitution and Intelligence
 - Fatigue Points - From Constitution and battle fatigue
 - Speed - From Dexterity and Strength and Intelligence

*** Skills

 - Eyesight (intelligence)
 - Hacking (intelligence, dexterity)
 - Research (intelligence)
 - Close combat (strength, dexterity)
 - Ranged combat (strength, dexterity)
 - Stealth (dexterity, intelligence)
 - Vehicles (dexterity)
 - Medicine (intelligence) 

** Rolls

Make it so that "average" skill of 10 is about equally likely to fail
as succeed. Must roll less than or equal to controlling stat to succeed. 

** Improving stats and skills: experience and leveling up

** Combat 

 - Player signals attack with M-direction

 : :action :attack :to attacker :from direction

 - This is resolved to: 

 : :action :attack :to attacker :from defender 

 - Attacker rolls dexterity for hit/miss. 
 - Attacker hits!
 - Attacker rolls Strength for damage power, add to weapon roll
 - Defender rolls Dexterity for dodge
 - If hit, roll Strength, modify by weapon strength and close/ranged combat skill  

 : :action :defend :to defender :from attacker :detail points

 - Defender rolls Strength to resist damage, modify by armor class, sends to self: 

 : :action damage :to self(defender) :detail points

Is this too complicated? 

* Places to visit

Each place will have associated enemies, items, and a selection of
special things to do.

 - Cold storage 665... find strange items
 - Highway 291-M (randomly generated name).. with a vehicle you can
   speedily navigate the universe
 - Caves with minerals to mine and freaky insects to defeat
 - Power transfer stations... radiation!
 - There was originally just an outpost on this planet, a research
   station... but eventually IT took over and hollowed out the
   planet...


** Grenades

There are also two types of grenades. First we have electromagnetic
pulse (EMP) grenades, which damage and temporarily freeze robots (and
you, if you're not careful!). On the other hand, there are
conventional explosive grenades, which do more damage and have no
freezing effect.

** Other 

Two types of levels: Corridors (i.e. long, unidirectional strip-like
levels with many distinct sections or rooms) and Chambers (sprawling
mazes or arenas.)

Player attributes are a bit simplified when compared with a typical
roguelike. Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Constitution, Hit
Points, Psi Points, etc.

 - Eyesight (intelligence)
 - Hacking (intelligence, dexterity)
 - Research (intelligence)
 - Close combat (strength, dexterity)
 - Ranged combat (strength, dexterity)
 - Stealth (dexterity, intelligence)
 - Vehicles (dexterity)
 - Medicine (intelligence)
