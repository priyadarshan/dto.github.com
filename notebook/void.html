<h2 id="sec-1">Overview </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
"Void Mission" is a sci-fi action roguelike divided into three
episodes. The action takes place in a 2-D pixeled future in which you
fly a transforming humanoid/jet suit in both exterior space and
interior environments while firing projectile and/or energy weapons at
enemies and simultaneously avoiding their fire. The story is largely
told through text, represented in the game as data files, emails, or
voice communications with a non-player character. Gameplay is tied
into the story with missions that require balancing combat with
exploration and puzzle solving.
</p>
<p>
Void Mission's game play is that of a rogue-like with simplified
controls. Only the four cardinal directions are available for movement
and firing, and the player can only carry or use a few (i.e. between 1
and 5) items at a time. The player also has fewer stats than in a
typical roguelike, but various upgrades make sure that character
development is still central.
</p>
<p>
Void Mission is slated for FREE release on Windows, Mac OSX (Intel
only), and GNU/Linux on August 10 2010.

<p>
It's 2061. If only there were enough endurium!
</p>
<p>
It's been known for decades that Humanity's reach within the Milky Way
is limited only by the supply of endurium, its rare and precious
fuel. The energy crises of C.E. 2021 and C.E. 2027-2031 caused global
economic, social, and environmental disruption, and with this
disorganization came the concentration of wealth and power in the
hands of the government and corporate elites.
</p>
<p>
Early attempts at control and regulation of endurium met with initial
success. The space-faring nations&mdash;Russia, China, India, Japan,
Brazil, and the United States&mdash;along with the ESA (European Space
Agency), could quite naturally claim endurium for themselves. But
economies of scale and espionage in spaceflight technology eventually
brought smaller deposits and endurium dust streams throughout the
interstellar neighborhood within the reach of multinational
corporations and various non-state actors. The largest of these formed
what they called a "sovereign", open, and successful market in
endurium, spaceflight technology, and various otherwise-controlled
materials. The split between the Spacefaring Nations on the one hand,
and the United Nations on the other, threatens to break into
full-scale interstellar war; as Earth's environment continues to
decay, the demand for endurium has reached a critical point.

<h2 id="sec-4">Plot </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p> 
A new high-powered telescope operated by Xiomacs Corporation detects a
pattern of gas streamers radiating high in the ultraviolet, within a
cavernous void in galactic space. Subsequent observations show that
the streamers are emitted from a string of black holes. The
scientists, seeing the pattern's obviously artificial nature, guess at
a propulsion method being used to drive a spacecraft, and begin to
look for something at the trail's leading edge. A year later one of
the flare-ups is observed, and the calculations fall into place: the
source of the black holes is an object about as massive as Jupiter,
but much smaller and far more dense. And it has been accelerating for
1.2 billion years by riding on streams of gas being ejected from the
black holes at relativistic speeds. It is given the name DVO1, for
Deep Void Object 1.
