<p>Hello <a href="http://planet.emacsen.org">Planet Emacsen</a> readers,
</p>
<p>
I thought I would post something because it's been a few weeks since
my last message. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://emacs-ontology-project.googlecode.com">Eon project</a> is in alpha and progressing at a reasonable pace. As I
may have mentioned before, I'm taking some deliberate steps to improve
my programming skills and development practices; working on Eon has
become a good way to learn.  
</p>
<p>
There's a lot of manual-reading, which is always healthy. But the most
effective thing for me has been learning directly from other
developers&mdash;by reading their code, or through discussions on
IRC. I've always been one of the "lone programmer" types, but now Eon
has two new developers (welcome Tom and Andre!) and a public
<a href="http://emacs-ontology-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/">Subversion repository</a>. With a few more decades of obsessive work and
deep self-abnegation, I may yet become a "real programmer".
</p>
<p>
Here's what I've been working on this week:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>the eon object system:</b> is being revised a bit to change the
   syntax of message sends and expand the notion of methods to include
   something like the Symbolics Genera "Presentation Type" system.

</li>
<li><b>vwindow</b> &mdash; This is a virtual window library that can superimpose
   what appear to be free-floating or pop-up Emacs windows on top of a
   buffer without disturbing the text. It will also include a
   preliminary replacement for the aging <b>widget.el</b> that comes with
   Emacs, and an abstract spreadsheet editor derived from my old
   <a href="http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/CellMode.html">cell-mode stuff</a>. My goal is much more than just to replace the X
   toolkit menus (which inexplicably block Emacs and its subprocesses
   while they are open) and the awful Customize interface with
   something much more powerful. I also want to make it easy for Emacs
   Lisp developers to separate their user interfaces from their
   application logic. Most Emacs packages build their user interfaces
   from scratch (possibly because the built-in widgets suck) which is
   why we have 3 different implementations of a spreadsheet UI widget
   (including mine) and God knows how many subtly different dired-like
   modes.

</li>
<li><b>ushell</b> &mdash; A universal shell inspired by the Genera "Dynamic Lisp
   Listener". This is intended to be a replacement for eshell (and
   much else) with the ability to talk to multiple "backends" in the
   same session. The <code>POSIX sh</code> backend works by talking to bash over
   a pipe or socket, which probably works better in the long run than
   trying to do serious process control or input redirection from
   within native Emacs Lisp. But it can also talk to snd, or sbcl, or
   stumpish, or any combination of the above&mdash;at the same command line.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
I'll keep you posted&hellip;
