#+TITLE: Eon mini-beta release
#+DESCRIPTION: Eon mini-beta release

I would like to put two small files out for your review. This is a
beta of Eon with some example code. Questions and comments on the
design and implementation are welcome.

I feel good enough about the state of Eon to start really building
some applications, but I wanted to throw Eon out there for some peer
review before I get going. It's been tremendously helpful in the past,
so keep those comments coming!

Downloads:

 - [[file:../eon/eon.el][eon.el]] --- the eon object system
 - [[file:../eon/eon-guide.el][eon-guide.el]] --- some working code examples to try

Requirements:

 - [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs 22]] or later
 - A method of generating UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers). By
   default, the external program "uuidgen" is used; this comes with
   the e2fsprogs package.
