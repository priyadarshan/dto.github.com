#+TITLE+: ecaspace

* About 

 *ecaspace* is a music creation tool built on [[http://www.eca.cx][Ecasound]] and GNU Emacs.

 *2007-01-25:* It is currently in pre-alpha but there is working
 code. You can [[file:../e/ecaspace.el][download ecaspace.el]]. Ecaspace depends on libraries
 that are changing fast right now, so please wait a few days before
 doing anything with it.

 Until then, look at the screenshot:

* Design

An *ecaspace* is a library of sound projects and recordings.  A
 *session* is a set of tracks. A *track* consists of an ecasound
input, a corresponding output, a set of operations to be performed,
and finally a collection of takes. A *take* identifies an individual
audio file. A *take set* is the set of new takes created when the
engine is started with record-enabled tracks.

* Inspiration

I recently decided to stop using [[http://ardour.org][Ardour.]] I have no use for
punch-in/punch out, really complex automations, or sequencing of
loops. Our band's style is about capturing the music as it happens,
and throwing away whole takes if it doesn't work.

I want to easily mix command-line batch processing tools (like
"soundmosaic") with automated multitrack processing... I have become
interested in the dialogue between live improvisation and "process
music" (i.e. two ends of a spectrum)

Playing with ecasound's Emacs Lisp interface has made me decide to
develop some Lisp tools for automating my workflow and for creating
new possibilities by integration with other tools (Snd, Common Lisp
Music, soundmosaic, etc)

* Sketch of album process

When you're in between songs, it should feel like you're in between
radio stations the way it happens when you move the dial around on an
old radio. There should be a bit of static and maybe you hear a third
song in there somewhere.

 *ecaradio* is an ecaspace module for assembling music on this model.
