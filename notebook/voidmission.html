<h2 id="sec-1">Overview </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
Void Mission is a science-fiction game inspired by roguelikes. It is
in an early stage of development right now because I am still working
on the <a href="RogueLike.html">engine.</a> But my notes are here for you to enjoy (and perhaps
comment upon?)
</p>
<p>
The main ideas of Void Mission are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploration and discovery
</li>
<li>Turn-based strategic combat utilizing hand weapons, robot suits,
   and vehicles, often with dozens of enemies at once
</li>
<li>Destructible and persistent environments
</li>
<li>Diverse gameplay styles (shooter, stealth, rpg)
</li>
<li>Randomly generated settings for a new experience each time.
</li>
<li>Atmospheric enhancement, with optional mood music. 
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Setting and structure </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
The story of Void Mission takes place in a remote research outpost
called Installation 774. It is the size of a small city and is
composed of square, uniformly-sized, interconnected modules whose
interiors may be configured for different purposes and environmental
conditions. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cold storage
</li>
<li>Datacenter
</li>
<li>Crew barracks
</li>
<li>Recreation area
</li>
<li>Command center 
</li>
<li>Laboratory
</li>
<li>Garage (armored suits, trucks, repair)
</li>
<li>Medical (health items)
</li>
<li>Robotics lab
</li>
</ul>


<p>
These modules are about the size of one city block, approx 60x60
cells. Various airlocks separate the modules from one another. Some
modules have become depressurized and therefore you need an armored
robo suit to explore them. Some areas are so radioactive or toxic that
only a remote-controlled bot can enter.
</p>
<p>
The city is designed to house about 1,000 employees, contractors,
military personnel, and various visitors.

<h2 id="sec-3">Ideas for roguelike activities </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<ul>
<li>Confront dozens or even hundreds of enemies at a time
</li>
<li>Wreak havoc in highly destructible environments
</li>
<li>Mine minerals and manufacture stuff with them
</li>
<li>Run around placing bombs on other objects/enemies, then run away
   and explode them! This idea is stolen from the PlayStation game
   "Silent Bomber."
</li>
<li>Feel the paranoia of never knowing what is around the corner
</li>
<li>Pit yourself against time as maps fill up with water or poison gas
</li>
<li>Destroy security cameras to prevent the BLS from seeing you
</li>
<li>Create temporary force fields to block enemies and protect yourself.
</li>
<li>Upgrade skills with chips/software/modules. You can find them by
   taking apart other machines.
</li>
<li>Locate schematics for fantastic devices and build them using raw
   materials and manufacturing work stations.
</li>
<li>Remote-control a limited robot in areas with too much radiation for humans to explore
</li>
<li>Get radiation sickness and take antidotes
</li>
<li>Experience and deal with extremes of temperature
</li>
<li>Researching objects, requires a workstation and research skill
</li>
<li>Stealth play, sneaking through dark areas to avoid detection
</li>
<li>Explore a machine-hollowed planetoid whose surface is speckled with
   numerous robotic installations and mysterious crash sites from a
   previous expedition
</li>
<li>Homage to Compile: a roguelike inspired by Zanac, Aleste, and Guardian Legend
   (this could absorb many of the ideas above)
</li>
<li>Surround yourself with slave robots who do your bidding and defend you from enemies
</li>
<li>Wear mecha suits of different types and capabilities. 
</li>
<li>Dyson sphere exploration (whoa)
</li>
<li>Opening of game: ship runs out of fuel soon after. You're stuck
   with no weapons, no fuel = no unassisted overworld travel.
</li>
<li>The ship in orbit guides you through the early part of the game and
   helps introduce the backplot, via radio, but they are destroyed by
   the BLS after the game's first real challenge.
</li>
<li>OK so i'm going to steal the rather cliche concept of a
   hyper-powerful race of Ancients who leave artifacts behind. Except,
   they did not inhabit our galaxy and only left behind a few sites,
   maybe three, which are jealously guarded and exploited by the
   Corporation for their technological value. What you discover is
   that this planet was a research station for the ancients, which
   makes it extraordinarily valuable in terms of technology and
   information.  Thus, the Corporation and the Authority, already in
   deep conflict, are both vying for control of this planet. The
   ancients are not gone, they just left the milky way out of fear of
   the BLS once it took over. The BLS is one of their experiments gone
   wrong. The Ancients created the faster-than-light drive, which
   humans discovered in a ship floating derelict. In fact perhaps the
   Corporation and the Authority have a monopoly on FTL travel and
   control it very strictly.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sec-4">Roleplaying system </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
The roleplaying system is a property of a particular RLX game, not of
RLX itself. This allows different games to use different and unrelated
roleplaying systems. This section of the document is about the
particular roleplaying system I am going to develop for my game. One
underlying principle is that there is no "character generation
screen". The character's attributes result entirely from in-game
actions over time.
</p>
<p>
At first I will just develop the basics, the raw minimum for a sci-fi
game to work, then develop it further.

<h3 id="sec-4-1">Stats </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">


<p>   
In the RPG system for Void Mission, numeric quantities like skills and
characteristics are subsumed into one idea: <b>stats</b>.
</p>
<p>
Both characteristics and skills enable you to do something, and can
change:
</p><ul>
<li>permanently, as when leveling up
</li>
<li>temporarily while certain items are equipped 
</li>
<li>temporarily while a certain effect is active
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Stat values factor into various computations: for example, eyesight
could determine the radius of your vision under normal lighting.
