#+TYP_TODO: PLANNED WORKING ALPHA BETA
#+TITLE: IOSKETCH

* Overview

IOSKETCH is a cross-platform visual authoring tool for games and other
interactive media. The design of IOSKETCH expands on [[http://scratch.mit.edu][MIT Scratch]],
and is built on a 2D game engine written in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp][Common Lisp]].

IOSKETCH can be used in tandem with [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][GNU Emacs]], with live integration
between the two via [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp][SLIME]] and custom code.

IOSKETCH is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software][free software]]. Read on for videos, features, and links to
more information.

* History

 - 2006: Game engine and interactive editor were prototyped in Emacs Lisp.
 - 2007-2009: Ported to Common Lisp, two games released (see links below.)
 - 2010: Two more games released. Engine greatly expanded with new
   functionality and new roadmap. Renamed to IOSKETCH and began
   implementing a Lispy visual programming language on top of the
   existing game engine and editor.

* Features

 - Custom [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming][prototype-based]] object system with built in serialization;
   save and load full state of game worlds.
 - Object-oriented 2D game engine with support for both tiles and
   sprites, scrolling backgrounds, and basic procedural generation
   tools.

 - Visual development environment, assembling behaviors from
   color-coded blocks representing Common Lisp objects. This is the
   newest part of IOSKETCH and a work-in-progress video may be seen here:
   [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmtALHVRSTU][Youtube video of in-progress IOSKETCH GUI]].
 - Emacs for code editing, asset management, version control, workflow
   via [[http://www.orgmode.org][Org-mode]], and integration with external programs. See [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43IiSvbyIZY][my screencast]] 
   about game development in Emacs.
 - LISPBUILDER-SDL for graphics, sound, joystick etc.
 - Compilation to efficient machine code via [[http://www.sbcl.org/][SBCL]].
 - Resulting apps run (so far) on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux.
 - Creation of redistributable standalone apps for any platform
   IOSKETCH runs on.
 - Or, distribution and sharing of projects separately from the IOSKETCH
   runtime as compressed archives.
 - Interactive command prompt with history, help, etc.
 - Generic media spreadsheet model and accompanying graphical editor.
 - "Modules" are like workbooks composed of many spreadsheets
 - 2D game world editor

 - Reasonably sized, at about 10,000 lines of Lisp code.
 - Fully free software (GPLv3) and based on open standards.

* Current status

 - Working alpha with [[http://dto.github.com/notebook/games.html][several games]] released.
