<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
I'm going to update the essay below
for the new pod and Debian.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Introduction </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
Over the last few years I've watched the GNU/Linux audio software
scene produce a wide array of professional-quality products. To use
these products to their fullest capacity you must have a machine that
runs them well, and this can mean a great deal of time spent choosing
the right parts and configuring the system's software to ensure the
best performance. 
</p>
<p>
Aside from a few public mailing lists, there didn't seem to be any
good comprehensive source of help for building a really solid Linux
Audio Workstation that Just Works. Despite being quite experienced
with Linux configuration I found it a challenge to get everything
working right. But over time my knowledge grew, I started making the
right choices in hardware and software, and before I knew it I was
ready to build a workstation that <i>really</i> worked.
</p>
<p>
This is the story of <b>the Pod</b>, my own foray into custom audio
workstation design.
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-front.jpg"  alt="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-front.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
I've decided to share my experiences building, configuring, and using
the Pod, in the hope that it will help create a community of people
sharing their own custom creations.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1">Design criteria </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">


<p>
Several criteria guided the design of the Pod as I moved from the
initial concept, to the frantic writing down of ideas, to a detailed
budget spreadsheet, and finally to the purchase of parts and assembly
of the final product.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-1-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-3-1-1">Build it powerful </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-1">


<p>
The Pod must be capable of recording many channels of audio to disk
simultaneously, with attendant effects processing, while playing back
even more channels&mdash;all with minimal latency. (This is the typical
use case for multitrack recording from multiple audio-producing
applications.)
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the machine should be fast and have a good amount of
memory, with fast disk drives, well-matched memory modules, and a good
motherboard.  It should also be equipped with as many discrete audio
input/output channels as are practical for the size and cost of the
machine.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-3-1-2">Build it tough </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-2">


<p>
Like much of a band's gear, the system may be transported in
less-than-ideal conditions (for example, the back of a pickup truck.)
Therefore the system should be ruggedized, shock-resistant, and
reasonably weatherproof. The system should store crucial audio data in
redundant RAID arrays to help prevent data loss in cases of equipment
damage or drive failure.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-1-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-3-1-3">Build it sexy </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-3">


<p>
The machine should have a unified, professional appearance. Therefore,
cool-looking, color-coordinating components are chosen, even when this
results in additional cost. Parts that show externally should be
chosen with care to ensure that colors and textures match.
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-open.jpg"  alt="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-open.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-1-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-3-1-4">Spare no expense </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-4">


<p>
The balance between function and cost should be tipped toward
function. Therefore, when choosing between parts of significantly
different price, choose the one that better fits the criteria listed
above.
</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Choosing hardware </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">



</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">System core </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">


<p>
At the time I built the Pod, the Athlon64 had only recently been
introduced, and there were great deals available on Athlon XP
hardware. I chose a
 <b>SOYO Dragon II</b> motherboard, 1 gigabyte of memory modules
recommended by SOYO, and an <b>AMD Athlon XP 3200</b> CPU. In retrospect
the system might have longer life had I gone with an Athlon 64, but in
truth, I haven't begun to tax the CPU power of the Pod even in complex
recording situations.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">Enclosures </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">


<p>
After a great deal of deliberation I settled on the
 <b>R908U20 Roto Shock Rack Case</b> from SKB Corporation, manufacturers of
a wide variety of protective cases for everything from guitars to
guns. I paid over US $400 for it, but as this protects a significant
hardware investment mounted inside, it's quite worth the money.
</p>
<p>
At 8 rack units high and with rack mounts in both front and rear, this
puppy is more than big enough to mount a full-size server PC chassis,
audio interface, power conditioner, and patch bay&mdash;and that leaves a unit
to spare! The case also includes tightly-locking rubber-sealed lids
to prevent water getting in during transport. They even included a set
of nice black rackmount screws with matching washers. 
</p>
<p>
The PC chassis took some time to select. Most rackmount PC cases are
meant for server use, and are thus quite ugly because nobody will ever
look at them. I finally found a sleek, black 4-unit-high chassis from
Athena Power corporation.
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-pc-out.jpg"  alt="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-pc-out.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
This is just about the sturdiest and roomiest PC case I have ever
handled, and probably the last I will buy for years. It's got a
great-looking front panel, lockable swinging front doors, along with
six full 5.25" and two 3.5" disk drive bays. Considering that I needed
to install three hard drives and two DVD drives, this was more than
enough and left room for future expansion.
</p>
<p>
One drawback: the chassis is quite heavy even without components
installed, and it became necessary to buy a pair of
 <b>Chatsworth equipment support brackets</b> (see <a href="http://www.chatsworth.com">Chatsworth.com</a>) to
support the weight of the completed PC's rear half. These are a
specialty product and I had to hunt for them, eventually finding a
supplier in <a href="http://www.graybar.com/">Graybar Telecom</a> of Somerville, Massachusetts.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3">Storage </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">


<p>
I chose a <b>Seagate 80GB 7200RPM ATA/133 hard disk drive</b> to store the
operating system, applications, and home directories. 
</p>
<p>
For audio files, I purchased 
 <b>two Seagate 200GB ATA/133 hard disk drives</b> and installed them as a
RAID-1 array, with the same data always stored on both drives. Not
only does this help prevent data loss if a drive dies, but it also
improves reading speed because the system can read simultaneously from
both disks. Think of multitrack recording, where many tracks are being
played back into monitor headphones while the vocal part is being
recorded.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-4">DVD reading/writing </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">


<p>
I purchased two DVD drives from LITE-ON corporation&mdash; one high-speed
reader for ripping discs, and one dual-layer burner for creating
mixdown CD's, DVD backups, and video DVD's. 
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-5">Audio I/O </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-5">


<p>
Of course, an audio workstation PC is only as good as its audio input
and output devices. Due to the state of driver support on Linux, one
must choose carefully. 
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-5-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-5-1">M-Audio Delta 1010 </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-5-1">


<p>
The <b>M-Audio Delta 1010</b> is, in my opinion, one of the finest PCI
audio interfaces for the money (about US $400) available today. The
Delta 1010 has 8 analog inputs and 8 analog outputs, along with a pair
of digital I/Os and MIDI jacks. The sound quality is fantastic and the
free Linux drivers support the card's great low-latency. 
</p>
<p>
The 19" rackmount external box of the Delta 1010 is one of the main
reasons I chose a rack case as the basis of the design.  
</p>
<p>
One minor issue: all the 1/4" audio jacks are in back of the unit. I
purchased a <b>Behringer Ultrapatch Pro</b> patch bay, simply to bring the
input and output jacks to the front of the machine where musicians can
easily plug in.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-5-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-5-2">KRK Rokit 8" self-powered monitors </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-5-2">


<p>
This is one of the rare instances where a Guitar Center employee
actually influenced my buying decision. I fell in love with the 
 <b>KRK Rokit 8" self-powered monitors</b> on first listen. Furthermore, I
 found the black-and-yellow color scheme to be a nice addition to the
 Pod's ambience. It was US $500 for the pair. 
</p>
<p>
I also bought a set of <b>Auralex monitor isolation pads</b> to "float" the
monitors and prevent their bases from transmitting too much
vibration to the studio furniture. 
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-5-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-5-3">Roland keyboard amplifier </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-5-3">


<p>
Since I don't want to take the delicate KRK monitors anywhere outside
the studio, I picked up a used <b>Roland KC-300 Keyboard Amplifier</b> from
a friend who was selling some gear. This is a sturdy keyboard amp,
perfect for synth sounds in a live situation.
</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-6">Cooling and noise management </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-6">


<p>
For a recording studio, all bets are off if the audio workstation
sounds like a vaccuum cleaner. I took great pains to get the Pod's
running noise level down to an absolute minimum.
</p>
<p>
First, I replaced all the fans with ultra-quiet models from
Zalman. They make a great "flower-shape" CPU cooler that makes
virtually no noise when running at its lower speeds. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-zalman.jpg"  alt="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-zalman.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
Second, I bought three <b>CoolerMaster CoolDrive</b> units, which cool and
muffle the hard drives. One of them is also a 4-way fan controller and
temperature monitor, wired up to all the fans in the system. In this
way I can run the fans at the lowest possible speed while monitoring
temperature safety. As usual, these fit into the black-and-silver
color scheme I'd been developing for the whole system. 
</p>
<p>
These were attached to the drive bay housings with rubber washers to
help stop disk vibration noise transmitting to the case itself. 
</p>
<p>
Third, I chose an ultra-quiet <b>Coolmax 550-watt ATX power supply</b>
with a controllable fan. When set to its lowest speed, this power
supply is virtually inaudible. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, I lined the entire PC chassis interior with
 <b>PAXmate adhesive noise insulation foam</b> to quiet any remaining
 sound.
</p>
<p>
As a result, the machine is almost completely silent when the front
bay doors are closed. 
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-7">Power management </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-7">


<p>
I bought a <b>Raxxess PD-800L</b> rackmount power distribution unit. This
is basically a rackmount surge protector and power strip, with plenty
of wide-spaced grounded outlets on the back, and one on the front. The
unit also has retractable lights on a dimmer switch, which can be used
to light up your work area during a gig at a club (where the lighting
situation is often less than optimal.)
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-8">MIDI controller </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-8">


<p>
I decided to buy the <b>M-Audio Keystation Pro 88 MIDI Controller</b>
almost as soon as I felt its keys in the store. I was taught to play
piano on rather stiff weighted keys, and can't stand the springy keys
of a synth. The Keystation has quite heavy action and I couldn't
resist buying it. It can also be powered via its USB connection,
alleviating the need for a separate power cord. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-keys.jpg"  alt="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-keys.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, it's got plenty of assignable general-purpose knobs and
buttons, offering the prospect of immediate tactile control over audio
software.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-9">Wireless keyboard/mouse combo </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-9">


<p>
And now for one of the finest keyboard/mouse combos available, the 
 <b>Logitech DiNovo Wireless Desktop</b>. The keyboard is ultra-slim and
 has laptop-like keys (but a decidedly desktop-esque full layout.)
 Crucial for a recording studio, the keyboard is also very quiet while
 typing at normal speeds. 
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-10" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-10">Miscellaneous </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-10">


<p>
At a local antique shop, I found a great set of chairs for the
musicians to sit in. They're from the sixties and made of yellow
vinyl&mdash;the exact same yellow as the cones on the KRK monitors! It was
US $35 for the pair. The chairs are armless, perfect for holding a
guitar while seated. 
</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Building the Pod </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
Construction was, for the most part, a straightforward matter. Because
the Athena Power case is so roomy, there were rarely any difficult
fittings. One great feature of the chassis is that each of the two
3x5.25" drive bay housings are removable, so you can mount the drives
while the bays are outside the case. This prevents any difficult
angles when driving screws. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-above.jpg"  alt="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-above.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
I installed one RAID disk in each of the two housings, both for weight
balance and to prevent both drives getting destroyed in case one whole
side of the Pod were to be crushed or damaged by water. 
</p>
<p>
One DVD drive went on each side, giving the retractable disc trays a
side-by-side configuration.
</p>
<p>
The system drive was installed inside the combination drive
cooler/temperature monitor (the part with the LCD screen in the photos
above.)
</p>
<p>
Before filling up the case, I lined the <b>entire</b> interior with 
 <b>PAXmate adhesive noise insulation foam</b>. This stuff is specifically
 designed for the interior of computer cases, and cuts easily with
 scissors. To stomp out all possible sources of noise, I covered every
 aperture of the case (even ventilation holes) and left only the two
 rear fans open for airflow. Combined with the air intake fans at the
 front of the Pod, this gives a complete flow of air through the
 inside of the chassis. The machine has an uptime of months, winter or
 summer, and has never overheated. 
</p>
<p>
Cable management was a bit difficult. There were five IDE devices
(three HDD, two DVD) with data and power lines for each, four
temperature probes, and four different fans to control. Furthermore I
had internal USB port cables, various motherboard pin connections, and
external lighting hookups to deal with. As you can see from the
following rear view of the drive housings, it's quite a tangle:
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-drives.jpg"  alt="http://dto.twu.net/images/pod-drives.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
I used cable ties and various other methods to keep things reasonably
organized. You don't want a stray cable touching a hot area, or
stopping a fan, so it's important to keep them from moving around
during transport. I also used highly flexible round IDE cables
wherever possible (they're gold and silver in the above photo.)
</p>
<p>
For managing external power and data cables, I used flexible cable
management tubes purchased at my local Staples office supply
store. They are visible in this rear view of the Pod. 
</p>
<p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Software configuration </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">


<p>
I chose Fedora Core 3 (current at the time) as a base operating system
for the Pod. However, much more configuration was needed to make the
Pod a fully operational audio workstation. The typical stock Linux
kernel does not support low-latency audio operation, nor are most of
the more useful applications included with a default installation of
Fedora. The following sections show what I did to get the Pod running.
</p>
<p>
Please note: code snippets in this section will be specific to Fedora
Core 3. Your mileage may vary with other versions. 
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-6-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-1">PlanetCCRMA </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">


<p>
The good news is that there's a great shortcut in setting up your
machine. The folks at Stanford University's CCRMA have already done
much of the hard work of configuring Fedora for audio workstation
use. They run a sort of "meta-distribution" that installs on top of
Fedora Core, called <a href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/">PlanetCCRMA</a> (pronounced "planet karma".) This work
saves so much time and effort that I decided to informally name the
Pod after it, sometimes calling such a machine a "KarmaPod".
</p>
<p>
PlanetCCRMA installs an enhanced low-latency Linux kernel, updated
ALSA drivers, and loads of high-quality audio and video
applications. There is a vast amount to explore here, and it's all
much easier than installing and configuring the packages
yourself. PlanetCCRMA enables you to replicate the environment that
computer music researchers have been using at Stanford, on your very
own workstation!
</p>
<p>
PlanetCCRMA is relatively easy to install. It involves first using RPM
to install their special pre-configured version of <b>apt-get</b>. Then all
you do is issue a few apt-get commands that will upgrade your system
and then download all the applications and drivers you need.
</p>
<p>
I will defer to CCRMA's web pages for more detailed install
instructions, as these may vary per your specific version of Fedora
Core. You can find the instructions at the <a href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/">PlanetCCRMA homepage.</a>

<h3 id="sec-6-2">Creating the RAID array </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">


<p>
I used the Linux Software RAID tools to create the RAID array.  Once I
had the device names of my two 200GB drives (/dev/hda and /dev/hdc) I
just had to issue a few commands to get it working. 
</p>
<p>
 <b>mdadm</b> is a program to create and manage RAID arrays under Linux
 Software Raid. It should be included with Fedora. The following
 command created the array:
</p>
<pre class="example">
/sbin/mdadm   --create /dev/md0 --auto=yes  \
              --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/hda /dev/hdc
</pre>


<p>
The "level 1" is for mirroring. This means both drives will always
hold the same data.

<p>
Next we must create a file system on the new device, <b>md0</b>. I chose
the Silicon Graphics XFS file system due to its support for large

The following command created the XFS file system:

<h3 id="sec-6-4">Starting the RAID array </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-4">


<p>
Upon each bootup, we must "assemble" and mount the RAID array.
</p>
<pre class="example">
/sbin/mdadm -A /dev/md0 /dev/hda /dev/hdc
mount -t xfs /dev/md0 /md0

<h3 id="sec-6-5">Mount configuration </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-5">


<p>
I don't like automatic updating of /etc/fstab. It can cause devices to
be mounted at odd times, instead of when the user commands the machine
to mount&mdash;which can cause latency problems. In Fedora Core 3, you can
turn it off with these commands:
</p>
<pre class="example">
FSTAB_SYNC_SYM=/etc/hal/device.d/50-fstab-sync.hal
rm -f $FSTAB_SYNC_SYM
ln -s /bin/false $FSTAB_SYNC_SYM
</pre>


<p>
(See the manual on <b>fstab-sync</b> for more information on disabling it
for your system.)
</p>
<p>
I also decided I don't like DVD drives being under "/media". Instead I
mount them at "/dvd1" and "/dvd2". These are easier to type than
"/media/cdrecorder" and so on. The following commands accomplish this.
</p>
<pre class="example">
# make backup of fstab
cd /etc
cp fstab fstab.bak

# fix default mountpoints by filtering fstab
(cat /etc/fstab.bak | sed \
-e "s:/media/cdrom:/dvd1:g" \
-e "s:/media/cdrecorder:/dvd2:g" \
-e "s:,managed: :g") &gt; fstab
</pre>

<h3 id="sec-6-6">Larswm </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-6">


<p>
For fast, efficient management of windows and desktops, may I humbly
recommend the <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~lab1701/larswm/">Lars Window Manager</a> (also known as Larswm.) Larswm is
known for its speed of operation and efficient resource usage. I've
found it to be a great companion to my audio work.
</p>
<p>
Just one example: Larswm binds many actions to the status bar at the
bottom of the screen. You don't have to actually find and hit a button
to switch desktops&mdash;just sweep the mouse to anywhere at the bottom of
the screen, and spin the mouse wheel to switch desktops quickly and
silently (once again, important when recording in the same room.) The
same goes for moving and resizing windows&mdash;you never have to hunt for
the tiny corners or edges of a window again.

<h3 id="sec-6-7">GNU Emacs and eev-mode </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-7">


<p>
<a href="GnuEmacs.html">GNU Emacs</a> is a great text editor, but did you also know it's an online
chat program, project management system, and enhanced system
administration tool? 
</p>
<p>
Emacs is also quite resource-efficient, when you consider how many
things it can do. This is important on an audio machine that doubles
as my personal PC. Emacs' variety of available tools makes it a viable
alternative to resource-hungry environments like GNOME.
</p>
<p>
I'll mention one other Emacs-related tool, called <a href="EevMode.html">EevMode</a>. It's a sort
of front end to the shell that helps in automating common tasks. I use
it to launch other applications from within Emacs, and to script
common tasks like CD/DVD burning. 
</p>

<h3 id="sec-6-8">Pure Data </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-8">


<p>
Miller Puckette's Pure Data is installed as part of PlanetCCRMA's
collection of audio applications. It's a low-latency audio processing
and synthesis environment designed around a graphical dataflow
language. While the learning curve is a bit steep at first, I've found
that Pure Data is a great environment for many types of audio
work&mdash;effects processing, routing, and especially in building
software synthesizers to control via MIDI. In fact, I specifically
chose the M-Audio Keystation 88 Pro because I knew it'd have plenty of
assignable knobs to control Pure Data.

<h2 id="sec-7">Results </h2>

<p>
I did not consider the weight of parts in my design &ndash; only
correctness according to the criteria set out at the beginning of this
essay. As a result, the Pod is so heavy I cannot lift it myself!  It
has good handles on the sides, so that two people can easily carry it,
but its weight must in all honesty be considered a drawback.
</p>
<p>
But the most important thing is: it works! No glitches, no crashes, no
problems. The Pod has been in the back of pickup trucks, SUV's, in
attics and basements, all without a hitch. It's a great recording
console and synthesis workstation for my own and my friends' musical
projects. I consider it a success.
