<h2 id="sec-1">About </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
Xalcyon is a challenging multidirectional PC shooting adventure game
with dual analog stick control and procedurally generated
levels. XALCYON is the sequel to <a href="http://dto.github.com/notebook/xong.html">XONG</a>, and exhibits the same 8-bit
home-computer-game audiovisual aesthetic that I employed in XONG&mdash;now
featuring the next generation in 12-bit graphics, and the power of
retro voice synthesis!
</p>
<p>
Xalcyon is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a> built with the free <a href="http://blocky.io">Blocky game engine</a>, and
is programmed entirely in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_lisp">Common Lisp</a>.

<h2 id="sec-4">Gameplay </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
Xalcyon requires a USB (or other compatible) game controller with dual
analog sticks and at least three buttons. The player uses the analog
sticks to independently control both movement and aiming/firing of his
robot as it fights through a series of ten increasingly difficult
levels. The sector maps are randomly generated from a library of
templates specifying different terrain and enemy combinations. Once
all enemies on a level are destroyed, the gateway to the next level
will appear.
</p>
<p>
As in XONG, one single hit from any bullet or enemy or explosion will
kill you and completely end the current game. However, you can simply
hit spacebar to generate a fresh scenario starting from
level 1. Sudden permadeath increases tension, but characters are quite
disposable, so it becomes a quest for perfection.
</p>
<p>
Your robot can hold and use one item at a time. The player starts the
game with a shield which blocks bullets coming from the direction the
right stick is aiming. The shield (or other item) can be activated by
pressing the left trigger. Items are found in boxes, or left behind by
smashed enemies.
</p>
<p>
The main gun is always equipped, and can be fired by pressing or
holding the right trigger. However, both shield and gun must consume
energy to operate. Your robot has a limited energy supply, and the
gauge will run out quickly if you use the shield for a long period
(even faster if you are also shooting the main gun.) When energy is
too low, you will not be able to use guns or shields for a few
moments, and will be highly vulnerable while you wait for it to
recharge.
</p>
<p>
The player can equip a bomb instead of the shield; these explode a few
seconds after being fired, and they stick to enemies and walls. But
there are enemies that can fire bombs at you too.
</p>
<p>
"Monitors" are orange robotic drones that patrol the fortress, firing
a spread of bullets before dashing away from the player. Highly
dangerous in groups. They turn red when they're badly damaged.
</p>
<p>
"Rooks" are purple spinning guys with a red nose and they fire bombs
at you.
</p>
<p>
"Biclops" inhabits Delta sector and is quite nasty, spewing radiation,
especially when he dies and his deadly pieces fly everywhere!
</p>
<p>
Much more to come&hellip;
