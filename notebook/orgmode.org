* About

Org-mode is a great personal information manager and project planning
tool for [[file:GnuEmacs.org][Gnu Emacs]]. You can get it from the [[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/org/][org-mode home page]]. I've
also posted a brief [[file:OrgTutorial.org][illustrated tutorial for org-mode]].

I've extended the HTML publishing support of Org-mode to allow
configurable publishing of related sets of files as a complete
website. My extension is called *org-publish*, and is used to upload
and manage these very pages!

 *Org-publish is now part of the org-mode distribution*. You no longer
 need to download it separately. I will continue to host other
 extensions, such as blogging and e-script publishing support, on this
 page.

[[file:../e/org-publish.el][org-publish.el]] can currently do the following: 

 + Publish all one's org-files to html
 + Upload html, images, attachments and other files to a web server
 + Exclude selected private pages from publishing
 + Publish a clickable index of pages
 + Manage local timestamps, for publishing only changed files
 + Accept plugin functions to extend range of publishable content

Much more functionality is planned. 

Special thanks to the org-mode maintainer, Carsten Dominik, for his
ideas, enthusiasm, and cooperation.

files using org-publish-attachment, but the index could be generated
by a special function that uses M-x thumbs mode to generate thumbnails
and upload them into a gallery-type page.
